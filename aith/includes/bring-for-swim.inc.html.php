Water temperature is expected to be between 62 & 66 degrees. The temperature will be taken on Friday and the morning of the race. Wetsuits are recommended but are optional for the swim but will provide buoyancy and warmth. However, many people opt for no wetsuit for a triathlon so no worries. We will provide you with a swim cap but you will want to bring your own goggles.
